# Tasks of Third Semester #

###  Graph Algorithms
* **Tarjan** #0, **Kosaraju** #1, **Floyd-Warshall** #4, **Prim** #6, **Kruscal** #7
    * n - number of vertexes
    * reading of graph:
        * count - number of edges
        * 3 numbers on every line - from, to, weight
* **Dijkstra** #2
    * reading of graph:
        * count - number of edges
        * 3 numbers on every line - from, to, weight
        * src - source vertex
* **Puzzle** #5
    * 5 lines with 5 numbers of tiles
    * 0 -- position of missing tile

### Flows
* **Max flow -- min cost** #14
	* n - number of vertexes
	* t - target
	* s - source
	* reading of graph:
	    * q - number of edges
        * 4 numbers on every line - from, to, capability, cost
    * output: max_flow, min_cost

### String Algoritms
* **–êho-Corasick** #13
    * N - amount of words
    * N words
    * s - text
